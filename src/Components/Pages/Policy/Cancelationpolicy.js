                    <p>Your appointments and convenience of making that appointment are of high importance to us. We realize that at times unexpected circumstances may require schedule adjustments. If you need to cancel an appointment, we respectfully require that you provide us with at least 12 hour notice.</p>
                    <p>We ask you to realize that when you forget your appointment or fail to cancel with enough notice in advance, we miss out on an opportunity to fill that time slot, and our standby clients miss the chance to receive our services.</p>
                    <p>Since we realize that it is easy to forget an appointment made months in advance, all our appointments are confirmed 24 hours in advance.</p>
                    <p>Cancellation fees will apply and we will require you to provide your credit card information before the booking is made.  </p>
