          <p>Upon receiving your request, we will need to verify your identity to determine you are the same
            person about whom we have the information in our system. These verification efforts require us
            to ask you to provide information so that we can match it with information you have previously
            provided us. For instance, depending on the type of request you submit, we may ask you to
            provide certain information so that we can match the information you provide with the
            information we already have on file, or we may contact you through a communication method
            (e.g., phone or email) that you have previously provided to us. We may also use
            other verification methods as the circumstances dictate.</p>

          <p>We will only use personal information provided in your request to verify your identity or authority
            to make the request. To the extent possible, we will avoid requesting additional information from
            you for the purposes of verification. However, if we cannot verify your identity from the
            information already maintained by us, we may request that you provide additional information
            for the purposes of verifying your identity and for security or fraud-prevention purposes. We will
            delete such additionally provided information as soon as we finish verifying you.

            You can designate an authorized agent to make a request under the CCPA on your behalf. We
            may deny a request from an authorized agent that does not submit proof that they have been
            validly authorized to act on your behalf in accordance with the CCPA.
            You may request to opt out from future selling of your personal information to third parties. Upon
            receiving an opt-out request, we will act upon the request as soon as feasibly possible, but no
            later than fifteen (15) days from the date of the request submission.
