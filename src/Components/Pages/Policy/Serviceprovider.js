                        LLC. (“Productive Alliance”), an online platform and virtual marketplace for “on demand” wellness
                        services (defined below), and _________________ (“PROVIDER”), an independent wellness

                    </strong>  </p>

                    <p >WHEREAS, PRODUCTIVE ALLIANCE operates an online marketing, sales, and
                        payment technology platform and virtual marketplace for “on demand” wellness services that
                        connects service providers with clients (which term shall, herein, include potential clients) for the
                        facilitation of “on demand” wellness services or “Engagements” (defined below), including the
                        sale, purchase and arranging of such Engagements by the respective parties. As a platform
                        operator, PRODUCTIVE ALLIANCE’s business is limited to the development, operation,
                        maintenance, and promotion of its platform, which focuses on maintaining and advancing the
                        technologies comprising the Productive Alliance platform, providing high quality user experience
                        (for both providers and clients), and expanding use of the PRODUCTIVE ALLIANCE platform
                        (by both providers and clients). PRODUCTIVE ALLIANCE does not provide, and is not licensed
                        to provide, wellness services of any kind, is not a service provider, and does not employ any
                        service providers for the purpose of providing wellness services. PRODUCTIVE ALLIANCE is
                        not and does not operate a wellness establishment, nor provide out-call wellness services. All
                        wellness services purchased and/or arranged using PRODUCTIVE ALLIANCE’s
                        platform are provided by the performing service provider, with PRODUCTIVE ALLIANCE’s
                        involvement being limited to the operation of the platform used to facilitate the service;
                    </p>

                    <p> WHEREAS, use of PRODUCTIVE ALLIANCE’s platform is limited to connecting
                        independent service providers engaged in the business of providing “on demand” wellness
                        services to clients seeking those services. As a platform operator, PRODUCTIVE ALLIANCE
                        may act as a referral source and refer potential clients to service providers and vice versa, but in
                        all such instances PRODUCTIVE ALLIANCE shall operate solely as an intermediary between
                        the client and independent service providers, and never functions as the provider of any
                        wellness services received by the client;
                    </p>
                    <p>  WHEREAS, “wellness service” means and refers to any virtual or in person service designed to
                        improve the mental or physical health or wellbeing of a client, including but not limited to
                        massage therapy, nutrition, fitness, beauty and aesthetician services, excluding at all times,
                        health care services and medical services; </p>
                    <p>  WHEREAS, PROVIDER is an independent wellness service provider or
                        independent wellness service business engaged in the business of providing “on demand”
                        wellness services for clients and is properly and currently licensed, where applicable, or
                        otherwise permitted to do so under applicable state and local law in the location in which
                        PROVIDER wishes to perform Engagements through PRODUCTIVE ALLIANCE’s platform;
                    </p>
                    <p>  WHEREAS, PROVIDER desires to enter into this Agreement for the right to use
                        PRODUCTIVE ALLIANCE’s platform to sell and arrange “on demand” wellness service
                        Engagements, including the right to accept Engagements referred by PRODUCTIVE ALLIANCE,
                        and the right to use the platform to facilitate and receive payment for each completed
                        Engagement in accordance with the terms of this Agreement; AND
                    </p>
                    <p> WHEREAS, PROVIDER and PRODUCTIVE ALLIANCE desire to enter into this
                        Agreement to establish the terms and conditions applicable to PROVIDER’s use of the
                        PRODUCTIVE ALLIANCE platform and the parties’ contractual relationship, including each
                        party’s rights and obligations relating to any wellness service Engagement covered by this
                        Agreement;  </p>
                    <p> In consideration of the above representations and the mutual covenants set forth
                        below, and for other good and valuable consideration, PRODUCTIVE ALLIANCE and
                        PROVIDER (collectively “the parties”) agree as follows:  </p>



                    <p><strong>TERMS</strong>   </p>
                    <p> <strong>PLEASE REVIEW THESE TERMS CAREFULLY, INCLUDING THE “ARBITRATION
                        PROVISION” SET FORTH BELOW IN SECTION 13, AS THIS AGREEMENT REQUIRES
                        PROVIDER TO RESOLVE DISPUTES WITH PRODUCTIVE ALLIANCE ON AN INDIVIDUAL
                        BASIS, EXCEPT AS PROVIDED IN SECTION 13, THROUGH FINAL AND BINDING
                        ARBITRATION. BY VIRTUE OF PROVIDER’S ELECTRONIC EXECUTION OF THIS
                        AGREEMENT, PROVIDER WILL BE ACKNOWLEDGING THAT PROVIDER HAS READ AND
                        UNDERSTOOD ALL OF THE TERMS OF THIS AGREEMENT (INCLUDING THE
                        ARBITRATION PROVISION IN SECTION 13) AND HAS TAKEN TIME TO CONSIDER THE
                        CONSEQUENCES OF THIS IMPORTANT BUSINESS DECISION.</strong>  </p>


                    <p style={{ textAlign: "start" }}> 1. USE OF PRODUCTIVE ALLIANCE’s PLATFORM  </p>
                    <p>  A. Subject to the terms and conditions contained herein, this Agreement shall give
                        PROVIDER the right to use PRODUCTIVE ALLIANCE’s platform to offer, arrange, sell and
                        perform wellness service Engagements for clients or potential clients, including clients or
                        potential clients that PRODUCTIVE ALLIANCE refers to PROVIDER (“Clients”), and to be paid
                        the agreed upon Service Fee (as described further below) for each completed Engagement.
                        PROVIDER acknowledges that it must provide accurate, complete and up to date information
                        about itself and its wellness service offerings on PRODUCTIVE ALLIANCE’s platform to enable
                        Clients to make an informed decision regarding whether to use PROVIDER and to decide which
                        wellness services to obtain from PROVIDER. This includes information such as the wellness
                        services offered by PROVIDER, PROVIDER’s experience level, PROVIDER’s expertise,
                        products used by PROVIDER, the locations in which PROVIDER offers wellness services, and
                        PROVIDER’s licenses, certifications, permits, or other qualifications.
                    </p>
                    <p> B. As used in this Agreement, the term “wellness service engagement” or “engagement”
                        (“Engagement”) shall be defined to include any wellness service session (of any type and
                        duration, whether in person or virtual) arranged using PRODUCTIVE ALLIANCE’s platform,
                        which may include some or all of the following parameters: Client name, Client-designated
                        service time (or available service window, if flexible), Client
                        designated service duration (as may be modified by negotiation between Client and Provider),
                        Client-designated location for performance of service (including in person or virtual locations),
                        and Client-requested wellness service type. Unless otherwise agreed by the parties, with the
                        exception of Client name and location, all Engagement parameters will be made available to
                        PROVIDER when PRODUCTIVE ALLIANCE offers an Engagement to PROVIDER. The
                        parameters and other terms of any Engagement may be modified by mutual agreement of the
                        applicable Client and PROVIDER, including negotiation of additional service time. While each
                        Engagement accepted by PROVIDER shall be subject to the terms of this Agreement, it shall
                        constitute a separate contractual arrangement enforceable on its own terms by Client and
                        PROVIDER.  </p>
                    <p> C. PRODUCTIVE ALLIANCE may refer Engagements to PROVIDER during those periods
                        that PROVIDER chooses to be available to receive such offers. Unless otherwise agreed,
                        PROVIDER shall have no obligation to be available to receive offered Engagements (or to log
                        into or use PRODUCTIVE ALLIANCE’s platform) at any specific time or for any particular
                        duration. PROVIDER has full control over when to log into or use PRODUCTIVE ALLIANCE’s
                        platform and when PROVIDER will be available to receive offered Engagements.  </p>
                    <p>D. PROVIDER may elect to use PRODUCTIVE ALLIANCE's feature that enables
                        PRODUCTIVE ALLIANCE to automatically assign Engagements to PROVIDER based on the
                        availability periods set by PROVIDER on PRODUCTIVE ALLIANCE's platform ("Instant
                        Confirmation" feature). Any Engagement assigned to PROVIDER via this feature will
                        automatically be added to PROVIDER's upcoming appointments list on PRODUCTIVE
                        ALLIANCE's platform, and PROVIDER will receive a push notification of such Engagement
                        (provided that PROVIDER has enabled push notifications on PROVIDER's relevant device). If
                        PROVIDER wishes to accept such Engagement, no further action by PROVIDER is required
                        prior to performance of the Engagement. If PROVIDER wishes to reject or cancel such
                        Engagement, PROVIDER should immediately cancel such Engagement via PRODUCTIVE
                        ALLIANCE's platform or by contacting PRODUCTIVE ALLIANCE's support team. For the
                        purposes of this Agreement, if PROVIDER is using the Instant Confirmation feature, the time of
                        acceptance of an Engagement shall be the time that PRODUCTIVE ALLIANCE assigns
                        PROVIDER such Engagement so long as PROVIDER does not cancel such Engagement.
                    </p>
                    <p>  E. Unless otherwise agreed or unless PROVIDER is using the Instant Confirmation
                        feature, in which case PROVIDER must either perform or cancel the assigned Engagement:
                        PROVIDER shall be entitled to accept, reject, ignore, or select among Engagements offered by
                        PRODUCTIVE ALLIANCE; shall have no obligation to accept any Engagement offered to
                        PROVIDER; and shall not be penalized for rejecting or ignoring offered Engagements.
                        PROVIDER is not required to accept any minimum or maximum number of offered
                        Engagements. Following acceptance of an Engagement (or, in the case of an Engagement
                        assigned via the Instant Confirmation feature, in the event that PROVIDER does not cancel the
                        Engagement), however, PROVIDER shall be obligated to perform the Engagement in
                        accordance with the terms of this Agreement and the Engagement parameters, unless
                        expressly waived by PRODUCTIVE ALLIANCE and/or the Client. </p>
                    <p> F. PRODUCTIVE ALLIANCE may, in its sole discretion, determine the method by which
                        PRODUCTIVE ALLIANCE offers Engagements to PROVIDER under this Agreement, including,
                        but not limited to, developing an algorithm for offering such Engagements that accounts for
                        client parameters, provider availability or location, and other factors PRODUCTIVE ALLIANCE
                        deems relevant. Nothing in this Agreement shall be construed as a guarantee that PROVIDER
                        shall be offered any particular number of Engagements during any particular time period. And
                        nothing in this Agreement shall prohibit PROVIDER from performing wellness service
                        engagements obtained through other means. In the event PROVIDER rejects, is unavailable,
                        fails to accept within a reasonable time, or is otherwise unable to perform any Engagement
                        specifically requesting PROVIDER’s services, PROVIDER shall not be penalized for such
                        unavailability and PRODUCTIVE ALLIANCE shall have the right to offer the Engagement to
                        other service providers within PRODUCTIVE ALLIANCE’s sole discretion.  </p>

                    <p style={{ textAlign: "start" }}> 2. PRODUCTIVE ALLIANCE’S SERVICES   </p>
                    <p>A. PRODUCTIVE ALLIANCE shall maintain an online platform, including developing and
                        maintaining an app accessible by computer and/or smartphone, which Clients and service
                        providers may use to order and/or arrange Engagements, and which PROVIDER may use to
                        sell, arrange and perform Engagements, including the right to receive and accept or reject
                        Engagements offered by PRODUCTIVE ALLIANCE. PRODUCTIVE ALLIANCE reserves the
                        right to additionally offer Engagements to PROVIDER using other means, such as by telephone,
                        text, and email. PROVIDER hereby agrees and expressly authorizes PRODUCTIVE ALLIANCE
                        to communicate such Engagement offers and any other information relating to PRODUCTIVE
                        ALLIANCE’s platform and PROVIDER’s use of same, by any means, including, but not limited
                        to, telephone, cell phone and email.  </p>


                    <p> <strong>B. PRODUCTIVE ALLIANCE shall also provide the following services to PROVIDER:</strong>  </p>

                    <div style={{ maxWidth: "90%", margin: "auto" }}>
                        <p style={{ textAlign: "start" }}><strong>1. Billing Service.</strong>PRODUCTIVE ALLIANCE shall provide an online, secure billing
                            and payment system for PROVIDER to receive payment for each completed Engagement.

                        </p>
                        <p style={{ textAlign: "start" }}><strong>2. Recordkeeping Service.</strong>PRODUCTIVE ALLIANCE shall maintain general
                            appointment and billing records of Engagements performed by PROVIDER.</p>


                        <p style={{ textAlign: "start" }}><strong>3. Administrative, Management, Marketing, & Technology Services.</strong>PRODUCTIVE ALLIANCE shall provide miscellaneous administrative, management, and
                            marketing services to facilitate PROVIDER’s business, including the technology and operations
                            necessary to communicate with Clients and PRODUCTIVE ALLIANCE’s customer experience
                            team.</p>



                        <p style={{ textAlign: "start" }}><strong>4. Customer Service. </strong> PRODUCTIVE ALLIANCE shall provide personnel to field
                            complaints and requests from both Clients and PROVIDER and provide any additional services,
                            including, but not limited to, PROVIDER access to PRODUCTIVE ALLIANCE’s Trust and Safety
                            Team. PRODUCTIVE ALLIANCE shall also provide personnel to further assist PROVIDER with
                            use of the PRODUCTIVE ALLIANCE platform and facilitation of Engagements.</p>





                        <p style={{ textAlign: "start" }}>C. PRODUCTIVE ALLIANCE’s services solely comprise of the services set forth in this
                            Section 2 and do not involve the provision of wellness services or the practice of
                            medicine. PROVIDER is solely responsible for providing wellness services and provides
                            wellness services directly to Clients and not to PRODUCTIVE ALLIANCE.</p>


                        <p style={{ textAlign: "start" }}>D. As a function of and to promote use of PRODUCTIVE ALLIANCE’s platform,
                            PRODUCTIVE ALLIANCE expends considerable capital to develop and maintain the platform’s
                            user base, including to generate Clients for PRODUCTIVE ALLIANCE to connect with and/or
                            refer to independent wellness service providers. Accordingly, while the Clients who use the
                            PRODUCTIVE ALLIANCE platform are mutual customers of PRODUCTIVE ALLIANCE and the
                            performing independent wellness service provider, it is critical that independent wellness service
                            providers not divert or seek to divert PRODUCTIVE ALLIANCE-generated business away from
                            the PRODUCTIVE ALLIANCE platform to preclude PRODUCTIVE ALLIANCE from receiving
                            payment for its referral services. This practice, known as “poaching,” includes any attempt
                            during the life of this Agreement to arrange for the performance of wellness services (whether
                            performed personally or by another) for a PRODUCTIVE ALLIANCE-referred Client outside the
                            referral arrangement created by this Agreement. However, nothing in this provision of this
                            Agreement shall in anyway prohibit or restrict PROVIDER from performing engagements directly
                            for clients PROVIDER generates or obtains outside of the arrangement established by this
                            Agreement. Poaching shall be deemed a material breach of this Agreement and could lead to
                            suspension from the PRODUCTIVE ALLIANCE network and/or termination of this Agreement.</p>

                    <p>A. Professional Conduct. PROVIDER desires to contract with PRODUCTIVE ALLIANCE
                        to use its platform to arrange and perform wellness services for Clients facilitated by
                        PRODUCTIVE ALLIANCE’s platform in a manner consistent with the highest standards of the
                        relevant professional wellness service and to obtain the additional services from PRODUCTIVE
                        ALLIANCE set forth above. PROVIDER agrees to perform each Engagement in compliance with
                        all applicable law and regulations, including those applicable to the relevant wellness service in
                        the state and locality for which PROVIDER performs the Engagement and those prohibiting
                        unprofessional, inappropriate conduct prohibited by law. PROVIDER further agrees to comply
                        with, for each Engagement, the then-current version of the following: i) the Terms and
                        Conditions agreement with PRODUCTIVE ALLIANCE, found at

                        for any updates or amendments made by PRODUCTIVE ALLIANCE that are applicable to
                        PROVIDER.</p>



                    <p><strong>B. PROVIDER’s Business.</strong> By signing this Agreement and under penalty of perjury,
                        PROVIDER affirms that PROVIDER is self-employed (if an individual), maintains and operates a
                        wellness service business that is separate and independent from PRODUCTIVE ALLIANCE,
                        holds himself or herself (if an individual) or itself (if an entity) out to the public as independently
                        competent and available to provide the applicable services, and has obtained and/or expects to
                        obtain clients for whom PROVIDER performs wellness services through other means than
                        PRODUCTIVE ALLIANCE and prior to entering into this Agreement. PROVIDER affirms that it
                        will only provide the wellness service which it is in the business of providing. PROVIDER shall
                        not represent that it performs any wellness services that PROVIDER does not perform in the
                        ordinary course of business, and PROVIDER shall not represent that it is practicing medicine.</p>
                    <p><strong>C. PROVIDER’s Employees and Agents.</strong> If PROVIDER is a business, PROVIDER has
                        the right to hire employees or subcontractors to perform wellness services for clients connected
                        through the PRODUCTIVE ALLIANCE platform, provided such employees or subcontractors
                        possess the credentials, training, experience, skill, and ability to perform such services and are
                        designated in a written agreement between PRODUCTIVE ALLIANCE and PROVIDER. For
                        purposes of this Agreement, any reference to PROVIDER shall be deemed to include such
                        employees or subcontractors and PROVIDER shall ensure such individuals comply with all of
                        PROVIDER’s obligations under this Agreement.</p>
                    <p><strong>D. Licensing and Certification.</strong> By signing this Agreement and under penalty of perjury,
                        PROVIDER further affirms that, as of the date of execution of this Agreement and as applicable
                        based on the type of wellness service provided by PROVIDER, PROVIDER currently
                        possesses, and will continue to possess for the duration of this Agreement, all licenses,
                        certifications, permits and other legal prerequisites necessary to perform such services, as
                        required by the state(s) and/or localities in which PROVIDER provides wellness services. To
                        ensure PROVIDER’s compliance with all legal requirements, PROVIDER must provide written
                        copies of all such licenses, certifications, permits and other legal prerequisites, as applicable,
                        within thirty (30) days of the date of execution of this Agreement, or when required by law,
                        whichever is earlier. Thereafter, PROVIDER must submit to PRODUCTIVE ALLIANCE current
                        copies of such licenses, certifications, etc. as they are renewed. To ensure all such certifications
                        and licenses remain current, PRODUCTIVE ALLIANCE shall, upon request, be entitled to review
                        such certifications and licenses from time to time. Failure to maintain current certifications,
                        licenses, permits, or other legal prerequisites, as applicable, or failure to comply with any other
                        provision of this paragraph, shall constitute a material breach of this Agreement. To ensure
                        PROVIDER meets all legal requirements and reasonable safety expectations of clients,
                        PROVIDER agrees and hereby authorizes PRODUCTIVE ALLIANCE to conduct a criminal
                        background check prior to granting PROVIDER access and use of its platform, and at least once
                        per year to ensure PROVIDER’s on-going compliance with all such legal and contractual
                        requirements; and all information PRODUCTIVE ALLIANCE obtains through such background
                        checks shall be used solely for such purposes.</p>
                    <p><strong>E. PROVIDER’s Right to Control Schedule.</strong>PROVIDER possesses unlimited flexibility to
                        set their own flexible hours of availability through the PRODUCTIVE ALLIANCE electronic
                        provider platform and/or sync their availability on a Google Calendar, Exchange Calendar, or
                        other calendar with PRODUCTIVE ALLIANCE’s scheduling system. PROVIDER is free to
                        accept, reject or ignore (except if PROVIDER is using the Instant Confirmation feature, in
                        which case PROVIDER must either perform or cancel the assigned Engagement) any
                        offered Engagements without penalty. PROVIDER acknowledges its opportunity for profit or
                        loss is dependent on PROVIDER’s own managerial skill. Once accepted, PROVIDER is
                        contractually bound to perform the Engagement in accordance with the details established by
                        the Client, including performance of services within the window identified by the Client and
                        agreed upon by PROVIDER at the time the Engagement is accepted.</p>
                    <p><strong>F. Engagement Details.</strong>. Once PROVIDER accepts (or, in the case of the Instance
                        Confirmation feature, once PRODUCTIVE ALLIANCE assigns) an Engagement, PRODUCTIVE
                        ALLIANCE will transmit electronically to PROVIDER the estimated Engagement parameters,
                        including, among other things, the details of the Engagement, the location and time of the
                        appointment or other appearance, confirmation of the Service Fee to be paid, and any and all
                        other Client specifications (collectively, the “Engagement Details”). Such Engagement Details
                        may be viewed by clicking on PROVIDER's relevant upcoming appointment via the
                        PRODUCTIVE ALLIANCE platform. Upon receipt or viewing of the Engagement Details,
                        PROVIDER may accept the Engagement through the “electronic provider platform”, or by
                        contacting PRODUCTIVE ALLIANCE to confirm acceptance of the Engagement (e.g., by email,
                        telephone or other means of communication). If the Engagement has already been assigned via
                        the Instant Confirmation feature and PROVIDER does not agree to the Engagement Details,
                        PROVIDER must immediately cancel the Engagement via the PRODUCTIVE ALLIANCE
                        platform or by contacting PRODUCTIVE ALLIANCE's support team. In the event any term
                        contained in the Engagement Details is inconsistent with the PROVIDER’s understanding of the
                        Engagement parameters, PROVIDER must immediately contact PRODUCTIVE ALLIANCE to
                        clarify the Engagement parameters before beginning performance of the Engagement,
                        otherwise PROVIDER shall be obligated to perform the Engagement as specified in the
                        Engagement Details (unless waived, canceled, or superseded by another communication from
                        PRODUCTIVE ALLIANCE).</p>
                    <p><strong>G. Service Change/Cancellation.</strong>In the event of a material change in the Engagement
                        Details, PROVIDER shall have the right to withdraw acceptance of the Engagement without
                        penalty. For the purpose of this section, a “material change” shall exist when one or more of the
                        following occurs: (1) the start time of the Engagement is changed by more than one (1) hour, (2)
                        the location of the Engagement is moved by more than twenty (20) miles; or (3) the parties
                        mutually agree that a change is material. In the event a Client cancels an Engagement after
                        acceptance by PROVIDER less than twenty-four (24) hours prior to the Engagement’s agreed
                        upon the start time, or fails to be available at that time (a “no show”), PROVIDER shall be paid a
                        cancellation fee. For the most up to date cancellation fees, PROVIDER should contact
                        PRODUCTIVE ALLIANCE's support team.
                    </p>
                    <p><strong>H. Service Failure.</strong> In the event of a Service Failure, PROVIDER shall forfeit all or a
                        portion of the fee for the Engagement when a Service Failure occurs depending upon the extent
                        of the Service Failure. A Service Failure may constitute a material breach of this Agreement and
                        could result in suspension from the PRODUCTIVE ALLIANCE platform or termination of this
                        Agreement. Service Failure shall be defined as and shall typically include, but is not limited to:
                    </p>




                    <div style={{ maxWidth: "80%", margin: "auto" }}>
                        <p><strong>i. failing to appear;</strong></p>
                        <p><strong>ii. failing to perform the service requested as ordered by Client;</strong></p>
                        <p><strong>iii. failing to perform the service during the agreed upon service window; and</strong></p>
                        <p><strong>iv. failing to adhere to the agreed upon service start time for the Engagement.</strong></p>
                    </div>










                    <p><strong>I. Notice of Cancellation. </strong>In the event PROVIDER anticipates it will be unable to perform
                        an Engagement consistent with the specified parameters (e.g., arrival at agreed-upon start time,
                        etc.), PROVIDER agrees to inform PRODUCTIVE ALLIANCE of the issue immediately by
                        telephone. Failure to do so shall be a material breach of this Agreement, and may subject
                        PROVIDER to damages payable to the Client and/or PRODUCTIVE ALLIANCE in the event
                        PRODUCTIVE ALLIANCE is unable to refer the Engagement to another service provider at the
                        same or similar economic terms, or if PRODUCTIVE ALLIANCE is required to pay any fees to
                        the Client as a result of PROVIDER’s failure.</p>
                    <p><strong>J. PROVIDER’s Right to Control Performance. </strong>PRODUCTIVE ALLIANCE shall have no
                        right to, and shall not, control the manner or prescribe the method PROVIDER uses to perform
                        accepted Engagements, subject to the terms of this Agreement. PROVIDER shall be solely
                        responsible for determining the most effective and efficient manner to perform the services
                        relating to each Engagement, subject to the terms of this Agreement and the applicable
                        Engagement Details.</p>
                    <p><strong>K. Non-Exclusive Relationship.</strong> The parties recognize that both PROVIDER and
                        PRODUCTIVE ALLIANCE are, or may be engaged in similar arrangements with others. Nothing
                        in this Agreement shall preclude PROVIDER from entering into arrangements similar to that
                        created by this Agreement with other on-demand wellness service platforms or wellness service
                        client referral sources, and PRODUCTIVE ALLIANCE shall have no right to restrict PROVIDER
                        from performing wellness services for any Client or on behalf of any business during or after the
                        life of this Agreement (subject to the “poaching” prohibition set forth in Section 2)</p>
                    <p>L. PROVIDER is not required to purchase, lease or rent any products, equipment or services from PRODUCTIVE ALLIANCE as a condition of entering into this Agreement.

                    </p>
                    <p><strong>4. PROVIDER’S TOOLS, INSTRUMENTALITIES & EQUIPMENT</strong></p>
                    <p>A. Subject only to requirements imposed by law, Engagement parameters, Client
                        specifications, and/or as otherwise set forth in this Agreement, PROVIDER shall direct in all
                        aspects the operation of any and all tools, instrumentalities and/or equipment used in the
                        performance of this Agreement and shall exercise full discretion and judgment as an
                        independent business in determining the means and methods of performance under this
                        Agreement. PROVIDER is solely responsible for all of PROVIDER’s own tools, equipment,
                        products, training, automobiles, office space, licensing, and any other materials or requirements
                        needed, desired or related to the Engagements. PROVIDER solely controls the amount of
                        investment in the Engagements, including all expenses on training and tools.
                    </p>
                    <p>B. PROVIDER is solely responsible for all costs and expenses incident to its equipment
                        or to performing services under this Agreement, including, but not limited to, wages,
                        employment taxes, tax withholding, Social Security, Workers’ Compensation Insurance, FICA,
                        unemployment compensation, medical insurance, life insurance, paid vacations, paid holidays,
                        pensions, excise taxes, permits of all types, gross revenue taxes, costs of fuel, fuel taxes,
                        equipment use fees and taxes, licensing fees, professional dues, insurance coverage and
                        premiums, any other costs or expenses connected with PROVIDER’s business, and any other
                        tax, fine or fee imposed or assessed against the equipment or PROVIDER by any state, local, or
                        federal authority as a result of an action by PROVIDER or its employees, agents, or
                        subcontractors in the performance of this Agreement. PROVIDER acknowledges and agrees
                        that PRODUCTIVE ALLIANCE will not reimburse PROVIDER for any such expenses.
                        PROVIDER further acknowledges that PRODUCTIVE ALLIANCE is not rendering legal, tax, or
                        investment advice, nor is PRODUCTIVE ALLIANCE a fiduciary of PROVIDER. Accordingly,
                        PROVIDER acknowledges that PROVIDER may seek advice from an appropriate professional
                        to comply with any and all applicable federal, state, and local laws or ordinances.</p>
                    <p><strong>5. RATING SYSTEM</strong></p>
                    <p>A. The parties acknowledge and agree that PRODUCTIVE ALLIANCE is not present
                        during an Engagement and does not monitor, supervise, inspect, or control the particulars,
                        quality or performance of PROVIDER’s work. PRODUCTIVE ALLIANCE’s electronic platform
                        allows Clients to provide feedback regarding service quality that may be considered when
                        engaging a service provider through the PRODUCTIVE ALLIANCE platform. Client feedback is
                        collected and summarized in a fashion using a star rating system, as PROVIDER’s rating is
                        based on a continuously growing collection of star reviews submitted by Clients. PRODUCTIVE
                        ALLIANCE also allows service providers to provide feedback regarding their interactions with
                        Clients and encourages PROVIDER to provide such feedback.</p>
                    <p>B. In addition to rating information being made available to the Client, it may also be
                        considered by PRODUCTIVE ALLIANCE when referring engagements to PROVIDER as well for
                        negotiation of the fees paid for PROVIDER’s services.</p>


                    <p><strong>6. SERVICE FEE; PAYMENT COLLECTION AND PROCESSING
                    </strong></p>
                    <p>A. For PROVIDER's performance of each Engagement under this Agreement,
                        PROVIDER will be paid a fee as set forth in the relevant Engagement Details ("Service Fee").
                        The Service Fees are dependent on factors such as the Productive Alliance Commission (as
                        described below) and the amount PRODUCTIVE ALLIANCE charges the Client for the relevant
                        Engagement. . It is PROVIDER's responsibility to check the Service Fee in the Engagement
                        Details prior to accepting or performing any Engagement, and if PROVIDER does not agree to
                        the such Service Fee for a particular potential Engagement, PROVIDER should not accept, or
                        should immediately cancel, the relevant Engagement. By accepting the relevant Engagement,
                        PROVIDER is deemed to accept the applicable Service Fee. For more information regarding the
                        Service Fees or if PROVIDER believes that a Service Fee is incorrect for a given Engagement,
                        PROVIDER should contact PRODUCTIVE ALLIANCE's support team.</p>


                    <p>B. PROVIDER hereby appoints PRODUCTIVE ALLIANCE as PROVIDER’s limited
                        payment collection agent solely for the purpose of accepting applicable payment from Clients
                        for each Engagement. PROVIDER agrees that payment made by a Client through
                        PRODUCTIVE ALLIANCE shall be considered the same as a payment made directly to
                        PROVIDER, and PROVIDER will provide its services to the Client in the agreed-upon manner
                        as if PROVIDER has received the payment. In exchange for its services, PRODUCTIVE
                        ALLIANCE shall charge PROVIDER a commission on the fees paid by a Client to PROVIDER
                        for each Engagement (“Productive Alliance Commission”). Tips will not be subject to any
                        Productive Alliance Commission. PRODUCTIVE ALLIANCE shall pay PROVIDER the Service
                        Fee for each Engagement as contemplated in the paragraph above, which Service Fee is
                        calculated by deducting the Productive Alliance Commission from the amount paid by Client for
                        the Engagement.</p>
                    <p>C. PROVIDER understands that PRODUCTIVE ALLIANCE accepts payments from
                        Clients as PROVIDER’s limited payment collection agent and that PRODUCTIVE ALLIANCE’s
                        obligation to pay PROVIDER is subject to and conditioned upon successful receipt of the
                        associated payments from Clients. In accepting appointment as the limited payment collection
                        agent of PROVIDER, Productive Alliance assumes no liability for any acts or omissions of the
                        Clients. PRODUCTIVE ALLIANCE reserves the right at its discretion to cancel or reverse any
                        payment, even if it has been previously confirmed by PRODUCTIVE ALLIANCE, as a result of
                        any mistake or error, including any mistaken pricing or service description or other error.</p>
                    <p>D. PRODUCTIVE ALLIANCE may offer Clients the ability to purchase service credits to
                        be redeemed in exchange for wellness services. PROVIDER understands and agrees that
                        PROVIDER is not entitled to receive any compensation from PRODUCTIVE ALLIANCE for any
                        Client’s purchase of any service credits. PROVIDER shall only be entitled to receive the
                        applicable Service Fee from PRODUCTIVE ALLIANCE once a Client redeems such service
                        credits by scheduling an Engagement with PROVIDER.</p>
                    <p><strong>7. PAYMENT DISPUTES</strong></p>
                    <p>A. PROVIDER’s Failure. In the event PROVIDER fails to perform the contracted services
                        consistent with the Engagement Details (i.e., a Service Failure), PROVIDER shall forfeit all or
                        part of the Service Fee (depending on the extent of the Service Failure, in PRODUCTIVE
                        ALLIANCE’s sole discretion). PRODUCTIVE ALLIANCE shall also have the right to recover its
                        damages either through arbitration or by other legal means contemplated by this Agreement.
                    </p>
                    <p>B. PRODUCTIVE ALLIANCE’s Failure. If payment from PRODUCTIVE ALLIANCE is
                        owed to PROVIDER under the terms of this Agreement, and such payment is not made in a
                        timely manner, PROVIDER shall have the right to seek payment either through arbitration or by
                        other legal means contemplated by this Agreement.</p>
                    <p><strong>8. INDEPENDENT CONTRACTOR RELATIONSHIP</strong></p>
                    <p>A. This Agreement is between two co-equal, independent business enterprises that are
                        separately owned and operated. The parties intend this Agreement to create the relationship of
                        referral service platform and independent contractor and not that of employer and employee.
                        The parties are not employees, agents, joint venturers or partners of each other for any
                        purpose. PROVIDER acknowledges its sole responsibility for complying with all federal, state
                        and local tax filing and payment obligations that pertain to any renumeration received from
                        Clients in connection with this Agreement.</p>
                    <p>B. As an independent contractor, PROVIDER recognizes that it (and its employees and
                        agents, if PROVIDER is an entity) is not entitled to minimum wage, overtime, meal or rest
                        breaks, workers’ compensation, sick leave, vacation, or other benefits or other equity during the
                        parties’ relationship, or unemployment benefits following termination of the parties’ relationship.
                        If PROVIDER (and any employees or agents of PROVIDER) are reclassified by a state or
                        federal agency or court as PRODUCTIVE ALLIANCE’s employees, PROVIDER (and its
                        employees and agents, as applicable) will become a reclassified employee and will not receive
                        and hereby elects not to participate in, on either a prospective or retrospective basis) benefits
                        from PRODUCTIVE ALLIANCE, except those mandated by state or federal law, even if by the
                        terms of PRODUCTIVE ALLIANCE’s benefit plans or programs of PRODUCTIVE ALLIANCE in
                        effect at the time of such reclassification, PROVIDER, or its employees or agents, as applicable,
                        would otherwise be eligible for such benefits.
                    </p>
                    <p>C. PROVIDER agrees that PROVIDER is not an “employee of” PRODUCTIVE ALLIANCE
                        and neither are PROVIDER’s employees or agents, if PROVIDER is an entity. Neither
                        PRODUCTIVE ALLIANCE nor PROVIDER shall have the right to bind the other by contract or
                        otherwise except as specifically provided in this Agreement.</p>
                    <p><strong>BY INITIALING TO THE RIGHT, PROVIDER REPRESENTS AND
                        ACKNOWLEDGES THE FOLLOWING:</strong></p>
                    <p><strong>(1) PROVIDER UNDERSTANDS THAT THIS AGREEMENT DOES
                        NOT CREATE AN EMPLOYER-EMPLOYEE RELATIONSHIP;</strong></p>
                    <p><strong>(2) PROVIDER SPECIFICALLY DESIRES AND INTENDS TO
                        OPERATE AS AN INDEPENDENT CONTRACTOR; AND</strong></p>
                    <p><strong>(3) AS AN INDEPENDENT CONTRACTOR, PROVIDER IS NOT
                        ENTITLED TO MINIMUM WAGE, OVERTIME, MEAL OR REST
                        BREAKS, WORKERS’ COMPENSATION OTHER BENEFITS OR
                        EQUITY DURING THE PARTIES’ RELATIONSHIP, OR
                        UNEMPLOYMENT BENEFITS FOLLOWING TERMINATION OF THE
                        PARTIES’ RELATIONSHIP (NOR ARE PROVIDER’S EMPLOYEES
                        OR AGENTS, IF ANY).
                    </strong></p>
                    <p><strong>9. GENERAL AND PROFESSIONAL LIABILITY INSURANCE</strong></p>
                    <p>A. PROVIDER agrees to maintain current during the life of this Agreement, General &
                        Professional Liability insurance of a type specifically written to cover on demand wellness
                        services with a minimum policy limit of $1,000,000 per incident and $2,000,000 aggregate,
                        which policy must be issued by an insurance company authorized to sell insurance in the state
                        or states in which PROVIDER performs services. PROVIDER acknowledges that failure to
                        secure or maintain satisfactory insurance coverage shall be deemed a material breach of this
                        Agreement.</p>
                    <p>B. To verify the above insurance requirement, PROVIDER agrees to provide a copy of a
                        certificate of insurance to PRODUCTIVE ALLIANCE which must be submitted prior to
                        PROVIDER’s acceptance of an Engagement. PROVIDER further agrees to provide an updated
                        certificate of insurance whenever PROVIDER’s policy is renewed, altered, or replaced, and to
                        provide immediate notice to PRODUCTIVE ALLIANCE if PROVIDER’s policy is cancelled.</p>
                    <p><strong>10. INDEMNITY</strong></p>
                    <p>A. PROVIDER agrees to indemnify, protect and hold harmless PRODUCTIVE ALLIANCE
                        and PRODUCTIVE ALLIANCE’s directors, officers, employees, agents, or advisors from any
                        and all claims, demands, damage, suits, losses, liabilities and causes of action arising directly or
                        indirectly from, as a result of or in connection with, PROVIDER’s actions (or omissions) arising
                        from PROVIDER’s obligations under this Agreement, including personal injury or death to any
                        person or liability for civil and/or criminal conduct (e.g., assault, battery, fraud); or any liability
                        arising from PROVIDER’s failure to comply with the terms of this Agreement. PROVIDER’s
                        obligations hereunder may include cost of defense for the indemnified party as well as the
                        payment of any final judgment rendered against the indemnified party</p>
                    <p>B. PROVIDER agrees that, in the event PRODUCTIVE ALLIANCE is held liable for any
                        injury or damage to any Client caused by PROVIDER, PRODUCTIVE ALLIANCE shall have the
                        right to recover such amount from PROVIDER. Similarly, should PRODUCTIVE ALLIANCE
                        voluntarily elect to pay any amount owed to a Client for damage or injury to a Client caused by
                        PROVIDER or for which PROVIDER is responsible and/or liable, PRODUCTIVE ALLIANCE shall
                        have the same right as the Client to recover from PROVIDER (i.e., PRODUCTIVE ALLIANCE
                        stands in the shoes of the Client). In such case, PRODUCTIVE ALLIANCE shall also be subject
                        to all obligations and restrictions applicable to the entity in whose shoes it stands.
                    </p>
                    <p>C. Unless resolved informally or in small claims court, all damage or injury claims
                        between PRODUCTIVE ALLIANCE and PROVIDER (including claims where PRODUCTIVE
                        ALLIANCE “stands in the shoes of” another) shall be resolved pursuant to the Arbitration
                        Provision contained in Section 13 below</p>
                    <p>D. These indemnities are in addition to (and not superseded by) any indemnities in the
                        Terms and Conditions agreement separately entered into between PROVIDER and
                        PRODUCTIVE ALLIANCE.</p>
                    <p><strong>11. DISCLAIMER</strong></p>



                    <p>A. PRODUCTIVE ALLIANCE makes no representations about the suitability, reliability,
                        availability, timeliness, and accuracy of the information, products, services on the platform for
                        any purpose even if PRODUCTIVE ALLIANCE knew, should have known, or was grossly
                        negligent. All products and services are provided "as is" without warranty of any kind.
                    </p>
                    <p>PRODUCTIVE ALLIANCE hereby disclaims all warranties and conditions of merchantability,
                        fitness for a particular purpose, workmanlike effort, title and non-infringement</p>
                    <p>B. Advice received via the PRODUCTIVE ALLIANCE site or from a PRODUCTIVE
                        ALLIANCE employee should not be relied upon and PROVIDER should consult an appropriate
                        professional for specific advice tailored to PROVIDER’s situation. In no event shall
                        PRODUCTIVE ALLIANCE be liable for any direct, indirect, punitive, incidental, special,
                        consequential damages or any damages whatsoever. In the event damages are ascertained
                        against PRODUCTIVE ALLIANCE such liability shall be limited to the lesser of either any
                        amounts owed to PROVIDER because of work PROVIDER did and which PRODUCTIVE
                        ALLIANCE previously agreed to give to PROVIDER or $500 as liquidated damages, an amount
                        which PROVIDER specifically acknowledges as a reasonable limit. PRODUCTIVE ALLIANCE
                        makes no warranties that the material on this site is legal or appropriate in any particular
                        country, state or county. If PROVIDER is dissatisfied with any of the goods or services, or with
                        any of these terms of use, PROVIDER’s sole and exclusive remedy is to discontinue using the
                        PRODUCTIVE ALLIANCE site, not buy PRODUCTIVE ALLIANCE’s products and/or use
                        PRODUCTIVE ALLIANCE’s services. PROVIDER’s use of PRODUCTIVE ALLIANCE’s site is at
                        PROVIDER’s own risk.</p>
                    <p>C. Linking to the front page of PRODUCTIVE ALLIANCE’s site may be done without
                        permission so long as the link does not derive from an obscene, scandalous, profane,
                        defamatory or unlawful site that, in PRODUCTIVE ALLIANCE’s sole discretion, adversely affects
                        the name or good will of PRODUCTIVE ALLIANCE. PRODUCTIVE ALLIANCE’s website may
                        contain links to other websites. PRODUCTIVE ALLIANCE is not responsible for the content of
                        these websites or for reviewing said sites.</p>
                    <p>D. These disclaimers and limitations of liability are in addition to (and not superseded by)
                        any disclaimers or limitations of liability in the Terms and Conditions agreement separately
                        entered into between PROVIDER and PRODUCTIVE ALLIANCE.
                    </p>
                    <p><strong>12. USE OF PRODUCTIVE ALLIANCE’S ONLINE PLATFORM AND INTELLECTUAL
                        PROPERTY</strong></p>

                        owners.</p>
                    <p>B. PROVIDER agrees not to disassemble, decompile, reverse engineer or otherwise
                        modify our Intellectual Property or our website. PROVIDER agrees to not use PRODUCTIVE
                        ALLIANCE trademarks, logos or slogans without written permission from an officer of
                        PRODUCTIVE ALLIANCE or as specifically provided to PROVIDER. PROVIDER agrees to not

                        PRODUCTIVE ALLIANCE. PROVIDER agrees that his use of the site and services are subject
                        to all applicable local, state, national and international laws and regulations and PROVIDER is
                        solely responsible for all acts or omissions that occur under his account or password, including,
                        without limitation, the contents of any transmissions through the Services for which he is

                    <p>C. PROVIDER agrees to not use PRODUCTIVE ALLIANCE’s site for any purpose that is
                        unlawful or prohibited by these terms, conditions, and notices, in any manner that could
                        damage, disable, overburden, or impair PRODUCTIVE ALLIANCE’s site. PRODUCTIVE
                        ALLIANCE may terminate access to the PRODUCTIVE ALLIANCE site at any time with or
                        without cause. Productive Alliance shall not be liable to user or any other party for termination of
                        the services or refusal to refer Clients to PROVIDER</p>
                    <p>D. PRODUCTIVE ALLIANCE agrees to keep PROVIDER’s confidential information
                        (“PROVIDER Confidential Information”) absolutely confidential, except as required or provided
                        by law. PROVIDER agrees to keep PRODUCTIVE ALLIANCE’s confidential information
                        (“PRODUCTIVE ALLIANCE Confidential Information”) absolutely confidential, except as required
                        or provided by law. PRODUCTIVE ALLIANCE Confidential Information includes but is not limited
                        to information about PRODUCTIVE ALLIANCE’s customer base, including Clients, Clients’
                        personal information, business model of creating a marketplace for connecting PROVIDERs with

                        assist PROVIDER’s existing business. PROVIDER also agrees to use and disclose information
                        about Clients only as necessary to perform the Engagements and PROVIDER’s obligations
                        under this Agreement and for no other purpose during the term of this Agreement. In the event
                        that PROVIDER becomes aware that it has received personal information of any Client that is
                        under the age of majority in the jurisdiction in which the services were performed, PROVIDER
                        shall promptly destroy such personal information. Upon termination of this Agreement,
                        PROVIDER shall return to PRODUCTIVE ALLIANCE or destroy any information PROVIDER
                        obtained about Clients through the platform and shall no longer maintain, use, or disclose such
                        information for any purpose, except as required by applicable law. Nothing in this section shall
                        prohibit PROVIDER from performing services using another third party platform or as an
                        independent business</p>

                        (including without limitation, “personal information” as defined under the California Consumer
                        Privacy Act of 2018, Cal. Civ. Code §§ 1798.100–1798.199, as amended – hereinafter the

                    <p>A. Except for Excluded Claims as defined below, in the event of a dispute between the
                        parties, the parties agree to resolve the dispute as described in this provision (the “Arbitration
                        Agreement”). This Arbitration Agreement is governed by the Federal Arbitration Act (9 U.S.C. §
                        1, et seq.) and evidences a transaction involving commerce. The terms of this Arbitration
                        Agreement govern any disputes between the parties, including disputes under the Terms and
                        Conditions, and any arbitration provision in the Terms and Conditions is superseded and
                        replaced by this Arbitration Agreement. If the Federal Arbitration Act is held not to apply, the
                        arbitration laws of the state in which PROVIDER performs wellness services pursuant to this
                        Agreement shall apply. This Arbitration Agreement applies to any dispute brought by either party
                        arising out of or related to this Platform User Agreement or the Terms and Conditions
                        agreement, including termination of the parties’ relationship. The provisions of this Arbitration
                        Agreement shall remain in force after the parties’ contractual relationship ends. BY AGREEING
                        TO ARBITRATE ALL SUCH DISPUTES, THE PARTIES TO THIS ARBITRATION AGREEMENT
                        AGREE THAT ALL SUCH DISPUTES WILL BE RESOLVED THROUGH BINDING
                        ARBITRATION BEFORE AN ARBITRATOR AND NOT BY WAY OF A COURT OR JURY
                        TRIAL.</p>
                    <p>1. Before any party may seek arbitration, the party must first send to the other
                        party or parties a written Notice of Dispute (“Notice”) describing the nature and basis of the
                        claim or dispute, and the requested relief. A Notice to Productive Alliance must be sent to:
                        Director of Operations, Productive Alliance, Inc., 3705 W Pico Blvd., PMB 21932, Los
                        Angeles, CA 90019. After the Notice is received, PROVIDER and Productive Alliance or the
                        applicable parties shall attempt to resolve the claim or dispute informally. If the parties do not
                        resolve the claim or dispute within thirty (30) days after the Notice is received, the dispute shall
                        be resolved through binding arbitration and any party may begin an arbitration proceeding. The
                        amount of any settlement offer made by any party may not be disclosed to the Arbitrator until
                        after the Arbitrator has determined the amount of the award, if any, to which either party is
                        entitled.
                    </p>
                    <p>2. Unless carved out below, claims involving the following disputes shall be
                        subject to arbitration under this Arbitration Agreement regardless of whether brought by
                        PROVIDER, PRODUCTIVE ALLIANCE or any agent acting on behalf of either: (1) disputes
                        arising out of or related to this Platform User Agreement or the Terms and Conditions agreement
                        and the relationship created thereby, including termination of the relationship and/or
                        agreements; (2) disputes arising out of or related to PROVIDER’s performance of services
                        pursuant to this Agreement; and (3) disputes arising out of or relating to PRODUCTIVE
                        ALLIANCE’s performance of the referral services contemplated by this Agreement; and (4)
                        disputes arising out of or relating to the interpretation, scope, or application of this Arbitration
                        Agreement, but not as to the enforceability, revocability or validity of the Arbitration Agreement
                        or any portion of the Arbitration Agreement. This Arbitration Agreement also applies, without
                        limitation, to disputes regarding any federal, state or municipal law regulating employment
                        relationships, trade secrets, unfair competition, compensation, meal or rest periods, expense
                        reimbursement, uniform maintenance, training, termination, discrimination or harassment and
                        claims arising under the Uniform Trade Secrets Act, Civil Rights Act of 1964, Americans With
                        Disabilities Act, Age Discrimination in Employment Act, Family Medical Leave Act, Fair Labor
                        Standards Act, Employee Retirement Income Security Act, Affordable Care Act, Genetic
                        Information Non-Discrimination Act, and state statutes, if any, addressing the same or similar
                        subject matters, and all other similar federal and state statutory and common law claims
                        (excluding workers’ compensation, state disability insurance and unemployment insurance
                        claims).</p>
                    <p>3. This Arbitration Agreement does not apply to claims for workers compensation,
                        state disability insurance, unemployment insurance benefits, or civil penalties brought under the
                        Private Attorney General Act (“PAGA”), to the extent such claims cannot be subject to arbitration
                        under applicable law, or any claim or cause of action that cannot be subject to arbitration as a
                        matter of law (collectively, the “Excluded Claims”). In the event a party brings multiple claims,
                        including an Excluded Claim, the Excluded Claims may be filed publicly with a court, while any
                        other claims will remain subject to mandatory arbitration. Claims may be brought before, and
                        remedies awarded by, an administrative agency if applicable law permits access to such an
                        agency notwithstanding the existence of this agreement to arbitrate. Such administrative claims
                        include without limitation claims or charges brought before the Equal Employment Opportunity
                        Commission (www.eeoc.gov), the U.S. Department of Labor (www.dol.gov), the National Labor
                        Relations Board (www.nlrb.gov), and the Office of Federal Contract Compliance Programs
                        (www.dol.gov/esa/ofccp). Nothing in this Arbitration Agreement or this Platform User Agreement
                        shall be deemed to preclude or excuse a party from bringing an administrative claim before any
                        agency in order to fulfill the party’s obligation to exhaust administrative remedies before making
                        a claim in arbitration. Claims that may be adjudicated in small claims court shall also be
                        excluded from coverage by this Arbitration Agreement.</p>
                    <p>4. All aspects of the arbitration proceeding, including, but not limited to, its
                        existence, the hearings, all rulings and the award of the Arbitrator and compliance therewith,
                        shall be strictly confidential. The parties agree to maintain confidentiality unless otherwise
                        required by law. This paragraph shall not prevent a party from submitting to a court of law any
                        information necessary to enforce this Agreement, to enforce or challenge an arbitration award,
                        or to seek injunctive or equitable relief.</p>
                    <p><strong>B. ARBITRATION PROCEDURE.</strong></p>
                    <p>Arbitration shall be administered by JAMS pursuant to
                        JAMS’ Streamlined Arbitration Rules and Procedures (currently available at
                        https://www.jamsadr.com/rules-streamlined-arbitration/) before a single, neutral Arbitrator
                        appointed by JAMS. The location of the arbitration proceeding shall be no more than 45 miles
                        from where PROVIDER performed services arranged by PRODUCTIVE ALLIANCE unless
                        each party to the arbitration agrees in writing otherwise. If PROVIDER no longer resides in the
                        general geographical vicinity from where PROVIDER performed the Engagement, PROVIDER
                        and PRODUCTIVE ALLIANCE shall agree to a location of the arbitration within 45 miles of
                        where PROVIDER resides</p>
                    <p>C. In arbitration, the parties shall have the right to conduct adequate civil discovery, bring
                        dispositive motions, and present witnesses and evidence as needed to present their cases and
                        defenses, and any disputes in this regard shall be resolved by the Arbitrator. The Arbitrator shall
                        also be empowered to determine if a matter is subject to this Arbitration Agreement. Nothing in
                        this Arbitration Agreement is intended to prevent either party from obtaining injunctive relief in
                        court to prevent irreparable harm pending the conclusion of any arbitration. PROVIDER hereby
                        consents to the personal jurisdiction and venue of the state and federal court in and for the
                        county in which PRODUCTIVE ALLIANCE’s headquarters are located for any court action
                        brought pursuant to this Arbitration Agreement.
                    </p>
                    <p>D. MAKING A DEMAND FOR ARBITRATION. A demand for arbitration must be in writing
                        and delivered by hand or first-class mail to the other party within the applicable statute of
                        limitations period. A demand to Productive Alliance must be sent to: Director of Operations,
                        Productive Alliance, Inc., 3705 W Pico Blvd., PMB 21932, Los Angeles, CA 90019. The
                        Arbitrator shall resolve all disputes regarding the timeliness or propriety of the demand for
                        arbitration.</p>
                    <p><strong>E. CLASS and COLLECTIVE ACTION WAIVER. PROVIDER AND PRODUCTIVE
                    </strong></p>
                    <p><strong>ALLIANCE AGREE TO BRING ANY DISPUTE IN ARBITRATION ON AN INDIVIDUAL BASIS
                        ONLY, AND NOT ON A CLASS OR COLLECTIVE ACTION BASIS. ACCORDINGLY:</strong></p>
                    <p><strong>1. Class Action Waiver. </strong>There shall be no right or authority for any dispute
                        to be brought, heard or arbitrated as a class action (“Class Action Waiver”). The Class
                        Action Waiver shall not be severable from this Arbitration Agreement in any case in which (1)
                        the dispute is filed as a class action and (2) there is a final judicial determination that the Class
                        Action Waiver is invalid, unenforceable, unconscionable, void or voidable. In such instances, the
                        class action must be litigated in a civil court of competent jurisdiction.</p>
                    <p><strong>2. Collective Action Waiver. There shall be no right or authority for any dispute to be
                        brought, heard or arbitrated as a collective action (“Collective Action Waiver”).</strong>The
                        Collective Action Waiver shall not be severable from this Arbitration Agreement in any case in
                        which (1) the dispute is filed as a collective action and (2) there is a final judicial determination
                        that the Collective Action Waiver is invalid, unenforceable, unconscionable, void or voidable. In
                        such instances, the collective action must be litigated in a civil court of competent jurisdiction</p>
                    <p>3. PROVIDER shall not be retaliated against, penalized or threatened with
                        possible penalty as a result of any attempt by PROVIDER to exercise rights protected under
                        Section 7 of the National Labor Relations Act, including the filing of or participation in a class or
                        collective action. However, PRODUCTIVE ALLIANCE may lawfully seek enforcement of this
                        Arbitration Agreement and the Class Action Waiver and Collective Action waiver and seek
                        dismissal of such class or collective action claims. Notwithstanding any other clause contained
                        in this Arbitration Agreement, any claim
                        that all or part of the Class Action Waiver or Collective Action Waiver is unenforceable,
                        unconscionable, void or voidable may be determined only by a court of competent jurisdiction
                        and not by an Arbitrator. The Class Action Waiver and Collective Action Waiver shall be
                        severable in any case in which the dispute is filed as an individual action and severance is
                        necessary to ensure that the individual action proceeds in arbitration.</p>
                    <p><strong>F. ATTORNEYS’ FEES AND ARBITRATION COSTS.</strong> Each party shall pay the fees for its
                        own attorneys, subject to any remedies to which that party may later be entitled under
                        applicable law. Costs incidental to the arbitration, including the cost of the Arbitrator and the
                        meeting site (“Arbitration Costs”), will be borne by PRODUCTIVE ALLIANCE and PROVIDER
                        equally, unless otherwise required by applicable law. Any dispute regarding a party’s obligation
                        to pay Arbitration Costs shall be determined by the Arbitrator. In the event PROVIDER contends
                        that, as a matter of law, it is not responsible for payment of any Arbitration Costs, PROVIDER
                        shall have no obligation to pay any portion of the contested Arbitration Costs until, and only if,
                        the Arbitrator determines that PROVIDER is responsible for the costs. If necessary for arbitration of the dispute, PRODUCTIVE ALLIANCE agrees to cover the amount of the
                        Arbitration Costs contested by PROVIDER until such time as the Arbitrator determines payment
                        responsibility. If the Arbitrator determines that PROVIDER is responsible for any amount of the
                        Arbitration Costs already paid by PRODUCTIVE ALLIANCE, PROVIDER shall remit payment of
                        that amount to PRODUCTIVE ALLIANCE within 30 days of the Arbitrator’s determination</p>
                    <p><strong>G. POST-HEARING PROCEDURES AND THE ARBITRAL AWARD.</strong> Within 30 days of
                        the close of the arbitration hearing (which period may be extended by stipulation of the parties),
                        any party shall have the right to prepare, serve on the other party and file with the Arbitrator a
                        post-arbitration brief. The Arbitrator may award any party any remedy to which that party is
                        entitled under applicable law, but such
                        remedies shall be limited to those that would be available to a party in his or her or its individual
                        capacity in a court of law for the claims presented to and decided by the Arbitrator, and no
                        remedies that otherwise would be available to an individual in a court of law will be forfeited by
                        virtue of this Arbitration Agreement. The Arbitrator shall issue a decision or award in writing,
                        stating the essential findings of fact and conclusions of law. Except as may be permitted or
                        required by law, as determined by the Arbitrator, neither a party nor an Arbitrator may disclose
                        the existence, content, or results of any arbitration hereunder without the prior written consent of
                        the parties. Judgment on the arbitration award may be entered in any court of competent
                        jurisdiction</p>
                    <p><strong>H. APPLICATION TO EXISTING CLAIMS AND CONTROVERSIES.</strong> This Arbitration
                        Agreement is intended broadly to apply to all covered controversies (as set forth above in
                        Section A.1 of this Arbitration Agreement), including those arising prior to and after the
                        execution of this Arbitration Agreement, as is permitted under Section 2 of the Federal
                        Arbitration Act.</p>
                    <p><strong>I. RIGHT TO CONSULT WITH AN ATTORNEY.</strong> PROVIDER has the right to consult
                        with private counsel of PROVIDER’s choice with respect to any aspect of, or any claim that
                        may be subject to, this Arbitration Agreement.</p>
                    <p><strong>J. ENFORCEMENT.</strong> Subject to the exceptions listed in Section E of this Arbitration
                        Agreement, in the event any portion of this Arbitration Agreement is deemed unenforceable, the
                        remainder of this Arbitration Agreement will be enforceable. If the Class Action Waiver or
                        Collective Action Waiver is deemed to be unenforceable, the parties agree that this Arbitration
                        Agreement is otherwise silent as to any party’s ability to bring a class, collective or
                        representative action in arbitration.</p>
                    <p><strong>14. ENTIRE AGREEMENT
                    </strong></p>
                    <p>A. This Agreement constitutes the entire agreement and understanding between the
                        parties and shall not be modified, altered, changed or amended in any respect, unless in writing
                        and signed by both parties. This Agreement supersedes any prior contract or other oral or
                        written communication between the Parties; provided, however, that PROVIDER acknowledges
                        having separately entered into i) the Online Terms, ii) the Productive Alliance Safe Policy, and iii)
                        the Privacy Policy, which agreements will be updated by PRODUCTIVE ALLIANCE from time to
                        time and are incorporated by reference herein. In the event of any inconsistencies between this
                        Agreement and the Terms and Conditions agreement, Productive Alliance Safe policy or Privacy
                        Policy, this Agreement shall govern (unless stated otherwise herein). The headings and
                        subheadings in this Agreement are for convenience only, confer no rights or obligations in either
                        party, and do not alter any terms of this Agreement. The parties represent and agree that they
                        fully understand their right to discuss all aspects of this Agreement with their attorneys, that they
                        have availed themselves of this right, that their attorneys have counseled them with respect
                        thereto, that they have carefully read all of the provisions of this Agreement, that they fully
                        understand those provisions and that they are voluntarily entering into this Agreement.</p>
                    <p><strong>15. ENFORCEMENT</strong></p>
                    <p>A. This Agreement shall be governed by the laws of the state in which PROVIDER
                        performs wellness services pursuant to this Agreement. If any term, provision, covenant or
                        condition of this Agreement, or the application thereof to any person, place or circumstance,
                        shall be held to be invalid, unenforceable or void, the remainder of this Agreement and such
                        term, provision, covenant or condition as applied to other persons, places and circumstances
                        shall remain in full force and effect.</p>
                    <p>B. PROVIDER may not assign, transfer or delegate this Agreement or any part of it
                        without PRODUCTIVE ALLIANCE’s prior written consent. PRODUCTIVE ALLIANCE may freely
                        transfer, assign or delegate all or any part of this Agreement, and any rights and duties
                        thereunder, upon the giving of notice. This Agreement will be binding upon and inure to the
                        benefit of the heirs, successors and permitted assignees of the parties.</p>
                    <p><strong>16. TERMINATION OF AGREEMENT</strong></p>
                    <p>A. This Agreement shall remain in effect until terminated as follows: 1. At any time upon
                        the mutual written consent of the parties hereto;</p>
                    <p>2. If one party has materially breached the Agreement, upon written notice,
                        including email, to the breaching party, with such notice specifying the breach relied upon</p>
                    <p>3. Upon PRODUCTIVE ALLIANCE providing written notice to PROVIDER that
                        PRODUCTIVE ALLIANCE has discontinued or decided to discontinue the entire or any part of
                        the PRODUCTIVE ALLIANCE platform, including to discontinue offering a platform to provide
                        the wellness services offered by PROVIDER (which PRODUCTIVE ALLIANCE may do in its
                        sole and absolute discretion);</p>
                    <p>4. By either party without cause upon thirty (30) days’ prior written notice to the
